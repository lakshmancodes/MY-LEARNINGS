'''for example we have to send the packages as same as we are using, then we can use the command named
"pip freeze" then we use the other command "pip freeze > requirements.txt",where we send all the packages to this file
then to cross check it we use the "cat requirements.txt", then he can save the file with any name and the use the command
"pip install -r filename", then he would be able to download the packages sent by me'''
